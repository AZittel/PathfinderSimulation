# Pathfinder Simulation

Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm devloped with java and javafx. 

## Motivation

Through a subject in my studies we were assigned to develop a component with Java in the backend and Javafx in the frontend and to integrate it into an existing framework. A fellow student and I decided to display the A* pathfinding algorithm visually inside the component.

## Lessons Learned
<ul>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Expanding my Java knowledge</li>
<li>Creating a javaFX application with fxml</li>
<li>Working with git and remote repositories</li>
<li>Understanding gradle</li>
<li>TTD</li>
</ul>


<p>Obstacles can be distributed on the map to make it more difficult to find the path.</p>
