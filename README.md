<h3>How to run the code</h3>
<p>Clone the repository to a directory on your machine</p>
<p>Start a terminal and switch the working directory to the root of the project</p>
<p>Now type: gradle clean run</p>
<p>The application should now be running</p>

<h3>What I have learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Expanding my Java knowledge</li>
<li>Creating a javaFX application with fxml</li>
<li>Working with git and remote repositories</li>
<li>Understanding gradle</li>
<li>TTD</li>

</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A fellow student and I created this project during a lecture in 2019/20.</p>
<p>This application written in Java and javaFX is just an extract from the whole project from the semester. <br>
This application allows the user to display the shortest path between two points on a map.<br>
For the implementation for the pathfinding we used the A* algorithm.
</p>

<p>Obstacles can be distributed on the map to make it more difficult to find the path.</p>

<p>The individual obstacles can also be customized to adapt the overcoming of the obstacle</p>
